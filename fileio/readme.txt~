The application name is searchString. This program takes two parameters, the first is the directory(or file) you want to do search in, the second is the string you want to find in the files.

The output contains two parts, the first part is the name of the file which contains the string, the second part is the line in the file which contains the string.

Sample command:

searchString ./dir1 really

this command will search the directory ./dir1 for the string "really".

result will be something like this:

./dir1/subdir1/b.txt really?
