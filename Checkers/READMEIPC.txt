The program is called Checkers. It has 3 sub processes, each of which will play a game with the parent.

For every single move, the program will print the move on the screen. If the move is made by the parent, it looks like:
    parent: 
    6 3 5 2 
(this is an example, indicating the parent move the red piece from point 6 3 to point 5 2)
If the move is made by the children, it looks like:
    child: 24405
    4 3 5 2
(the number 24405 is the pid of this child)

The program will print the board on the screen constantly.

If any of the 3 games is over, the program will print message like
    RED WIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
or
    BLACK WIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
on the screen.

When all of the 3 games are over, the program will exit.

In this program, the parent is always using red pieces.
