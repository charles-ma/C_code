1. Multiplication of Matrices

I use 3 samples to test the performance. 
    Sample 1 multiplies two matices of size 500(sample500.txt)
    Sample 2 multiplies two matices of size 750(sample750.txt)	
    Sample 3 multiplies two matices of size 1000(sample1000.txt)
Because it may take time to print the final result on the screen, during my experiment, I commented out the code for output. The result is as follows:

matrix size = 500
thread Num    1          2         4          8          16          32          64
time   	      1.381	 0.892	   0.867      0.861	 0.856	     0.863	 0.877
	      
matrix size = 750
thread Num    1          2         4          8          16          32          64
time   	      5.746	 3.186	   2.960      2.920	 2.948	     2.953	 2.932

matrix size = 1000
thread Num    1          2         4          8          16          32          64
time   	      16.989	 9.221	   7.466      7.466	 7.337	     7.559	 7.462
