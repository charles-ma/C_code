1.The file test.c contains the main function
2.The main function executes the tests for different functions in files question*.c
3.Tests for question 1 and 2 have no explicit output; test for question 3 should output a sorted array; test for question 4 should output a sorted linked list; 
4.You can run the .sh file to get the running time of the realloc session (without comparisons). If you do want to see the difference of the running time, change the code in question5.c a little bit and compile it again. 
5.My recorded running time of the two different approaches is 0.045s and 0.023s. The program will be more efficient when you use factor 2 to realloc the memory space

How to use
Run the make file and run ./test. After this if you want to get the running time of ./test, run the .sh file in bash
